# Versioning System
Used after version 1.8, SnakeGame now uses a versioning system of releases and revisions. For example, the first revision of v1.8 is v1.8r1, but for the first, we leave out the initial release of a version. The second revision would be v1.8r2. This will be used because using traditional numberings just does not make sense to me for this project.
